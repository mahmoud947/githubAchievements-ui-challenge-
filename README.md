# GitHub Achievements UI Challenge

This repository contains the source code for the GitHub Achievements UI Challenge, a Flutter app that showcases achievements in a visually appealing way.

## Description

The GitHub Achievements UI Challenge is a Flutter app that demonstrates a UI design concept for displaying achievements. It features a stack of achievements that can be swiped through using a PageView, with each achievement having its own unique image, title, description, and unlocked date.

The app utilizes Flutter's animation and bloc architecture to create smooth transitions and state management. It also uses the `palette_generator` package to extract dominant colors from achievement images and applies them to the background gradient.
